# WordPress Widget - (j9r) Text

The (j9r) Text widget is an enhanced version of the built-in WordPress Text widget.

## Features
The (j9r) Text widget allows you to enter a title and text content just like the WordPress built-in Text widget.

The widget supports the following features for configuring the `Title`:
* Allows entry of `Title` content
* Provides an option to enable/disable rendering of `Title` to output
* Allows entry of a URL to transform `Title` into a link
* Provides an option to open `Title` in a new window/tab when selected

The widget supports the following features for configuring the `Content`:
* Allows entry of `Content` text
* Allows entry of a CSS class or space separated classes to attach to the `<div>` wrapper of `Content`
* Provides an option to automatically add paragraphs to `Content` (identical to built-in widget)
* Runs `Content` through a filter to make `<img>` tags responsive (uses WordPress `wp_make_content_images_responsive` function).
